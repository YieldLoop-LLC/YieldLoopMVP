## Purpose of This Document

This document is the **entry point to the YieldLoop ecosystem**.

It is written for:
- First-time readers
- Non-crypto users
- TradFi-minded investors
- Potential partners
- Anyone asking: *“What is this, really?”*

This is **not** a whitepaper.  
This is **not** marketing fluff.  
This is the **orientation layer**.

If you read only one document before deciding whether YieldLoop is worth your time, **this is the one**.

Its goals are to:
- Explain what YieldLoop is and is not
- Establish the mental model for how the system works
- Set expectations around risk, behavior, and incentives
- Create clarity, confidence, and (yes) a little FOMO
- Prepare the reader to dive deeper into the rest of the documentation set

Think of this as:
- A prospectus  
- An ecosystem walkthrough  
- A UX explanation  
- A straight-faced advertisement  
rolled into one.

## How This Document Should Be Used

- **Read this first**
- Do not skip ahead to technical docs without this context
- If something feels “boring” here, that is intentional
- YieldLoop is designed to reward patience, discipline, and system quality — not hype

After this document, every other document becomes easier to understand.
