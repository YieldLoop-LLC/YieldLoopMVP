## Document Purpose & Authority

This document defines **all Genesis, team, and family participation programs** within YieldLoop.

It is the single authoritative source for:
- Genesis NFT definitions
- Benefits and limitations
- Team and family wallet rules and restrictions
- Funding sources for all incentives
- Marketing/partnership minting authority

If it is not written here, it does not exist.

## 1. Design Philosophy

YieldLoop separates **who receives benefits** from **where those benefits are funded**.

This separation exists to:
- Preserve transparency
- Avoid cross-subsidization
- Maintain clean accounting
- Prevent incentive leakage

Participants may receive similar benefit levels.  
**Funding sources are always distinct and explicit.**

---

YieldLoop supports:
1. **Basic Genesis NFT** (public, accessible, time-bound)
2. **Lifetime Genesis NFT** (public, scarce, permanent)

4. **Family & friends wallets** (whitelisted, non-NFT, restricted)

---

## 6. Team + Family Wallet Program (Non-NFT)

### 6.1 Definitions
Team and family wallets are **whitelisted wallets** that:
- Are not NFTs
- Are not transferable entitlements
- Have benefits only while the wallet remains eligible

They may receive Lifetime-equivalent benefit levels, but are never funded from marketing.

---

## 7. Team Wallets (Restricted)

### 7.1 Cap & Eligibility
- Up to **20 team wallets** may be whitelisted total
- Initial roles may include:
  - Founder / System Architect
  - Executive / Project Lead
  - CTO
  - Lead Developers
  - CFO
  - CMO
  - Advisors

### 7.2 Benefit Level (What They Receive)
Team wallets receive:
- **50% performance fee discount (Lifetime-equivalent)**
- **Deposit incentive equivalent to Lifetime Genesis**
- Access to **Team Discord channel** (separate from public Genesis channels)

### 7.3 Funding Source (Critical)
All team wallet incentives are funded **exclusively from the dev/ops budget**.

They are dollar-mirrored to Lifetime incentives and do not pull from marketing.

### 7.4 Restrictions (What They Cannot Do)
Team wallets are subject to the following restrictions:

**A. Non-transferable entitlement**
- Whitelist status is tied to a specific wallet address.
- It cannot be sold, transferred, leased, or assigned.

**B. No stacking**
- Team wallet benefits do not stack with:
  - Basic Genesis
  - Lifetime Genesis
  - Any future discount program
- If a wallet holds NFTs, the system applies the single best eligible benefit (never additive).

**C. No governance via whitelist**
- Team wallet status grants no governance rights.
- Governance rights, if any, are separate and explicitly defined elsewhere.

**D. Hard cap enforcement**
- The total number of whitelisted team wallets may never exceed 20.

**E. Separation of funds**
- Team incentives are never funded from the marketing budget.
- Team incentives cannot reduce or divert public Genesis incentives.

**F. Eligibility requirements**
Team wallets must:
- Maintain **≥ $1,000** deposited balance (maintenance threshold)
- Remain active (see Section 9)
- Comply with any security requirements (e.g., multisig / hardware wallet guidance)

Failure to meet requirements results in whitelist expiration.

Marketing budget funds:
- Basic Genesis incentives
- Lifetime Genesis incentives

### 10.2 Dev/Ops Budget Funds
