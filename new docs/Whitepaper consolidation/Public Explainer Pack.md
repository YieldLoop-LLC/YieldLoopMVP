## 1. What Is YieldLoop?

YieldLoop is an automated trading protocol built for people who prefer **boring, honest systems** over flashy promises.

It uses:
- Isolated user vaults (not pooled funds)
- Real trading strategies (not emissions)
- Realized profit only (not projections)
- Clear failure handling (losses are possible)

YieldLoop does not promise yield.  
It attempts to **earn profit through disciplined trading** and reports results only after trades are closed.

Sometimes that profit is zero.  
Sometimes it’s negative.  
That’s the point.

---

## 2. What YieldLoop Is *Not*

YieldLoop is **not**:
- A bank
- A savings account
- A yield farm
- A staking product
- A token emission scheme
- A guaranteed-income system

There are:
- No APYs
- No projections
- No “expected returns”
- No compounding without approval

If you’re looking for excitement, this is the wrong place.

## 3. How YieldLoop Works (Simple Walkthrough)

1. You connect your wallet
2. You create a vault (your vault, not shared)
3. You deposit funds (minimum $250)
4. The system proposes a trading strategy
5. You approve or reject it
6. Trades execute only after approval
7. Positions close
8. Results are settled
9. Profit (if any) becomes withdrawable

No live profit displays.  
No paper gains.  
No pretending.

---

## 4. Vaults: Why Isolation Matters

Each YieldLoop vault is isolated.

That means:
- Your funds are never mixed with others
- Other users cannot affect your results
- One vault failing does not impact others

If your vault loses money, that loss is yours alone.  
If your vault earns profit, that profit is yours alone.

This is intentional.

---

## 5. Profit and Loss (The Honest Part)

YieldLoop only recognizes **realized profit**.

That means:
- Profit is counted only after trades are closed
- Unrealized gains are ignored
- Losses reduce your principal immediately
- Fees are charged only on profit, never on losses

There is no smoothing.  
There is no recovery trading.  
There is no hiding drawdowns.

---

## 6. Fees (Simple and Clear)

YieldLoop charges a **performance fee only when profit exists**.

- If there is no profit, there is no fee.
- If there is a loss, YieldLoop earns nothing.

Fee rates depend on how you choose to receive profit:
- USDT payout → 15%
- LOOP receipt token → 10%

There are no deposit fees.  
There are no withdrawal fees on profit.

---

## 7. LOOP: What It Is (and Isn’t)

LOOP is an **optional receipt token**.

It represents:
- Real profit
- Already earned
- Already settled

LOOP is:
- Minted only when profit exists
- Backed 1:1 by USDT
- Burned when redeemed
- Optional

LOOP is **not**:
- A stablecoin
- A yield token
- A speculative emission
- Required to use YieldLoop

If you don’t want LOOP, you don’t need it.

---

## 8. Withdrawing Funds

You can withdraw:
- Profit (USDT) when available
- LOOP by redeeming it for USDT
- Principal when your vault is closed

Withdrawals are subject to normal blockchain conditions (gas, congestion).

---

## 9. Emergency Withdrawals (When Things Go Wrong)

If markets or infrastructure break, YieldLoop allows **emergency withdrawals**.

Emergency withdrawals:
- Are USDT-only
- May close positions at a loss
- Ignore LOOP preference
- Prioritize getting you out safely

This is not a “panic button for profit.”
It’s a safety exit.

---

## 10. Governance and Control

YieldLoop is managed by:
- A multisignature admin council
- Timelocked changes for sensitive actions

Admins can:
- Pause trading
- Pause deposits
- Trigger emergency modes

Admins **cannot**:
- Take user funds
- Change accounting outcomes
- Mint LOOP arbitrarily
- Bypass core rules

---

## 11. Risks You Should Understand

YieldLoop involves real trading and real markets.

Risks include:
- Market losses
- Liquidity failures
- Oracle outages
- Smart contract bugs
- Network congestion

YieldLoop does not insure losses.
There is no safety net.

Use it only if you understand that.

---

## 12. Who YieldLoop Is For

YieldLoop is for people who:
- Prefer truth over hype
- Accept losses as part of reality
- Want transparency over promises
- Understand DeFi risk

If you want guaranteed yield, this is not it.
