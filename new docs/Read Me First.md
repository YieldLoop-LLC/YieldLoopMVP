## Read This Before Anything Else

I’m going to explain YieldLoop plainly.

Not as a pitch.  
Not as hype.  
Not as a promise.

If you’re looking for excitement, there are better places.  
If you’re looking for a system that doesn’t lie to you about how money behaves, keep reading.

This document is a **walkthrough**:
- how YieldLoop works
- what it feels like to use
- how value moves through it
- where your choices are
- where they are not

All formal rules live elsewhere.  
This document helps you understand them before you meet them.

## Why YieldLoop Exists

Most crypto systems fail for the same reason:

They are designed to look good before they are designed to hold up.

They optimize:
- dashboards
- APY screenshots
- constant activity
- narrative momentum

And then they act surprised when reality shows up.

YieldLoop exists because we decided to remove the parts that keep breaking.

---

## What YieldLoop Is (Plain English)

YieldLoop is an **automated trading system** built around **isolated user vaults** and **fixed cycles**.

You don’t deposit into a pool.  
You don’t backstop other users.  
You don’t depend on the crowd behaving.

You get **your own vault**.

One user.  
One vault.  
One outcome.

---

## What It Feels Like to Use YieldLoop

You connect a wallet.

Before you deposit, you see:
- the minimum deposit
- how cycles work
- how settlement works
- how exits work
- what the system explicitly does *not* promise

Nothing is hidden behind excitement.

You deposit funds into your vault.

The system proposes a strategy.
Not a prediction.
Not an APY.
A description of behavior.

You approve it.

Then something unusual happens.

The system gets quiet.

No live PnL fireworks.  
No flashing numbers.  
No “check back in five minutes.”

Execution happens when conditions make sense.
Sometimes that means trades.
Sometimes it means nothing.

Both are valid outcomes.

---

## Cycles Are the Spine of the System

YieldLoop runs in **fixed cycles**.

That’s deliberate.

Cycles force:
- accounting
- settlement
- decision points

At the end of each cycle:
- positions are closed
- profit or loss is finalized
- fees (if any) are applied
- you choose what happens next

Nothing rolls forever without your consent.

This is how risk stays bounded.

---

## Where Your Money Is (and Isn’t)

Your funds:
- remain on-chain
- stay in your vault
- are never pooled with other users
- are never used to cover someone else’s losses

If another vault fails, yours doesn’t notice.

There is no bank-run dynamic here.
There is nothing to rush.

---

## Fees (Only When They’re Earned)

YieldLoop charges **performance fees only**.

No profit → no fee.

No management fees.  
No deposit fees.  
No withdrawal penalties.

If you’ve been around crypto long enough, that alone should feel different.

---

## Settlement: USDT or LOOP

At the end of a cycle, you choose how to take value out.

### USDT

USDT is the default.

If you want:
- clarity
- liquidity
- familiarity
- clean exits

You take USDT and move on.

No lockups.
No persuasion.
No dependency on anything else.

This path exists so the system never traps users.

---

### LOOP

LOOP is optional.

LOOP exists for users who:
- plan to stay
- want deferred value
- care about system alignment

When you select LOOP:
- your post-fee profit is routed into the LOOP mechanism
- LOOP represents a claim backed by realized system value
- LOOP is not required to participate in YieldLoop

It’s not a meme.
It’s not a promise.
It’s an accounting instrument.

---

## The Ratcheting Floor (Why Some People Lean In)

LOOP has a **ratcheting floor**.

When the system produces real profit:
- backing is allocated
- the floor steps up
- and it does not step back down

No profit → no movement.

The floor only moves in one direction, and only when value is earned.

Slow.
Deliberate.
Unimpressive on purpose.

That’s how you avoid reflexive collapse.

---

## Genesis Access (Early, Not Magical)

YieldLoop offers Genesis access to early participants.

Genesis exists to:
- reduce fees
- offer limited incentives
- reward early conviction

There are:
- time-bound Genesis options
- lifetime Genesis options

Genesis does **not**:
- grant governance
- grant execution priority
- change risk rules

If Genesis matters to you, it’s there.
If it doesn’t, the system still works.

---

## Yes, the Team Uses the System

We don’t trust systems where builders don’t share the consequences.

Team and family wallets:
- use the same vault model
- follow the same cycles
- cannot bypass guardrails

Any incentives they receive are:
- explicitly funded
- accounted for separately
- not taken from users

If the system underperforms, we feel it too.

That’s alignment, not marketing.

---

## When Things Go Wrong (Because They Will)

YieldLoop assumes failure is possible.

That’s why it has:
- isolated vaults
- emergency states
- explicit exits
- liveness guarantees

In an emergency:
- access matters more than optimization
- exits matter more than price
- clarity matters more than spin

You can leave.

Always.

---

## Who This Is For (and Who It Isn’t)

YieldLoop is for people who:
- prefer systems over stories
- don’t want constant stimulation
- value exits more than promises
- think in cycles, not tweets

It is not for:
- APR chasers
- leverage addicts
- people who need entertainment from finance

That’s not a judgment.
It’s a boundary.

---

## The Point

YieldLoop isn’t trying to be exciting.

It’s trying to be **honest about how money actually works**.

No mascots.
No countdowns.
No pretending risk doesn’t exist.

Just a system that:
- does what it says
- stops when it should
- lets you walk away clean

If that sounds boring—

Good.

**YieldLoop**  
*Boring. On purpose.*
