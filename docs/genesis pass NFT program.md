# YieldLoop — Genesis Pass NFT Program

**Applies To:** YieldLoop v1.x  
**Status:** Canonical / Production-Ready  
**Author:** Todd Koletsky  

---

## Plain-English Summary

Two passes. One cheap, one less cheap. Neither is an investment.

Genesis Pass NFTs provide **fee discounts** (only on **realized profit**) and optional **deposit-credit subsidies** (non-withdrawable).  
They may end up being worth **nothing**. That is intentional.

YieldLoop works without them.

---

## What These Passes Are

Genesis Pass NFTs are optional utility passes intended to:
- support protocol development before launch
- reduce friction for new vault creation via **deposit credits**
- provide **capped performance-fee discounts**
- provide access and community perks (Discord, early visibility)

---

## What These Passes Are Not

- Not an investment contract  
- Not a yield product or revenue share  
- Not a governance token  
- Not a dividend or payout instrument  
- Not a promise that you will make money  

If no profit is realized, fee discounts do nothing.  
If no deposit is made, deposit credits do nothing.

## Deposit Credit Rules (Applies to Both Passes)

Deposit credits are **vault-creation subsidies**, not income.

- Credits apply only when creating a new vault  
- Minimum deposit requirement must be met  
- Credits are **non-withdrawable**, **non-transferable**, and **non-splittable**  
- Credits are **burned on use**  
- Credits cannot be applied retroactively  
- Credits may be **zero** in any given distribution period  
- Credits do not affect NAV, profit, or LOOP accounting  

---

### Credit Expiration and Reclamation

- Deposit credits **expire 90 days after issuance** if unused  
- Any **unused or expired Genesis Pass deposit credits** are permanently reclaimed by the protocol  
- Reclaimed credits are routed **one-way** into the **Ratchet Pool**

This action:
- Creates **no user claim**  
- Provides **no guarantee**  
- Does not imply price support  
- May have **no observable effect**

The ratchet may pause indefinitely regardless of reclaimed credit inflows.

---

## Protocol Safeguards (Hard Rules)

- No Genesis Pass modifies vault execution logic  
- No Genesis Pass alters risk limits or guardrails  
- All vaults operate under identical safety constraints  
- Fee discounts apply only at settlement on realized profit  
- Deposit credits never appear in vault accounting  

---

## Team Allocation and Use

### Genesis Lite Pass — Team Reserve (Initial)

- The team receives an **initial allocation of 250 Genesis Lite Passes**
- Purpose: promotions, partnerships, community outreach, and strategic distribution

---

### Genesis Lite Pass — Ongoing Team Minting (Cumulative)

In addition to the initial allocation, the team may mint additional Genesis Lite Passes for promotional use under a strict, adoption-linked rule:

- For every **100 Genesis Lite Passes sold to the public**, the team may mint **5 additional Genesis Lite Passes**
- This minting allowance is **cumulative**

**Examples**
- 100 sold → up to 5 additional team mints

  - promotions  
  - partnerships  
  - community outreach

---

## Parameter Policy (Non-Negotiable)

Genesis Pass parameters — discounts, pool shares, durations — may be **improved** in the future if conditions permit.

They will **never be made worse** for existing holders.

If you buy a pass, the terms you bought are the **floor**, not the ceiling.

---
