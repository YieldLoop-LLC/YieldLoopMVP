# YieldLoop — Genesis Pass NFT Program

**Applies To:** YieldLoop v1.x  
**Status:** Canonical / Public-Facing  
**Author:** Todd Koletsky  

---

## Plain-English Summary

Two passes. One cheap, one less cheap. Neither is an investment.  
Both provide **fee discounts** (only on **realized profit**) and optional **deposit-credit subsidies** (non-withdrawable).  
Both may end up being worth **nothing**. That’s the point: this is a **fundraiser + utility pass**, not a yield product.

---

## What These Passes Are

Genesis Pass NFTs are optional “coupon + access” passes intended to:
- support protocol development before launch
- reduce friction for new vault creation via **deposit credits**
- provide **capped fee discounts** (applied only on realized profit at settlement)
- provide community / access perks (Discord + early access)

YieldLoop works without them.

---

## What These Passes Are Not

- Not an investment contract  
- Not a yield product or revenue share  
- Not a governance token  
- Not transferable reward instruments (no “profit share,” no “dividend,” no “payout”)  
- Not a promise that you will make money  

Fee discounts only matter **if profit is realized**.  
Deposit credits only matter **if you deposit**.  
Discord access only matters **if you show up**.  
None of this is guaranteed to be worth anything.

## Deposit Credit Rules (Applies to Both Passes)

Deposit credits are **a vault-creation subsidy**, not income.

- Deposit credits only apply **if you meet the minimum deposit requirement**
- Credits **cannot** be withdrawn, transferred, or split
- Credits **cannot** be applied retroactively
- Credits are **burned on use**
- Credits **cannot accumulate indefinitely**
- Credits may be **zero** in any given month
- Credits apply to **vault creation** only (not adding capital to an existing vault)

---

## Protocol Safeguards (Hard Rules)

- Deposit credits are **burned on use**
- Credits **cannot** accumulate indefinitely
- Credits cannot be withdrawn, transferred, or split
- Fee discounts apply only at settlement on **realized profit**
- No pass modifies vault execution logic, risk limits, or safety thresholds
- All vaults operate under identical guardrails regardless of pass ownership

---

## Future Parameters (Non-Negotiable Policy)

Pass parameters — discounts, pool shares, eligibility windows — may be improved in the future if conditions permit.  
They will **never be made worse** for existing holders.

If you buy a pass today, the terms you bought are the **floor**, not the ceiling.

---

## Team Allocation

### Lite Pass — Team Mint (Cumulative)
- For every **100 Lite Passes sold**, the team may mint **5 additional Lite Passes** (cumulative).  
  - 200 sold → up to 10 mintable, etc.
- These are intended for promotions, partnerships, and marketing outreach — not personal enrichment.

### Lifetime Pass — Team Reserve
- Passes **501–550** are allocated to the team for the same purpose: promotions, partnerships, and strategic distribution.
- These are **not sold** on the open market.

---

## Team Wallet Whitelist (Operational Limit)

- **Max team wallets:** 10  
- **Family/Friend wallets per team member:** 2  
- **Max total whitelisted wallets:** 30  

All team expenses related to these wallets come from the operations and development budget.  
No special fund. No hidden allocation.  
If the team uses YieldLoop, they use it under the **same guardrails** as everyone else.

---

## Required Disclosures (Keep This Everywhere)

Genesis Pass NFTs are not investments, yield products, profit shares, or dividends.  
All benefits are optional, usage-based, and may be zero.  
Deposit credits may not be issued in any given month.  
Fee discounts apply only to realized profit and provide no benefit if no profit is realized.  
The program may be paused at any time.  
Existing pass terms will not be reduced below the terms purchased.
